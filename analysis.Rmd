## Synopsis
While tornados resulted in the most fatalities, both in total and on average, most injuries come from wildfires (total) and heat waves (on average). Property and crop damage share a common theme: too much water isn't good. Floods, hurricanes, and typhoons top the lists, both in total and on average.
